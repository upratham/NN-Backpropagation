# Simple Neural Network Backpropogation From Scratch (NumPy)

This repository contains a minimal implementation of a **fully-connected neural network** built **from scratch using NumPy**.  
The notebook shows:

- How to define a neural network class with one hidden layer  
- How to implement **forward propagation** and **backpropagation** manually  
- How to train the network using **gradient descent**  
- How the **training error** evolves over iterations

## Repository Structure

- `back_propogation.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook with the neural network implementation, training loop, and error plot  
- `README.md` – This file  

---

## Requirements

This project uses Python 3 and the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `jupyter` (to run the notebook)

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
